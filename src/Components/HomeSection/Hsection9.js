                We're doing this challenge, because we KNOW that when you have
                success selling your products through funnels, you're more
                likely to continue to use ClickFunnels to grow your company...{" "}
              </p>

              <p>
                That's it... that's our "evil" ulterior motive - for you to have
                success so you keep using our software that is giving you that
                success.

              Plus, we also pay our affiliates who refer people to this
              challenge $100 for anyone they signup. Chances are you found out
              about this page from one of those affiliates. So, we actually lose
              money for each person who joins the challenge.
            </p>
            <p>
              And the few of you who signup without an affiliate telling you
              about this challenge, you probably found out about it because I
              paid for an ad on Facebook or Youtube to get you here.
            </p>

            <p>
              Either way, I REALLY make very little, and in most cases lose
              money for each person who joins this challenge.
            </p>
            <p>So, why would I do this?</p>
            <p>
              Because we have a philosophy here at ClickFunnels, that if we
              can't make you money, then we don't deserve any of yours.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              So our goal is to help you make money... then hopefully you'll
              chose to re-invest some of those profits back into the products
              and services that we sell.

              But, more importantly, what about the people you could have served
              with your products or services that won't have a chance to hear
              about them, because you waited to launch your next funnel!

              There is an old Chinese proverb that says, "the best time to plant
